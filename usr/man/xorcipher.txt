Xorcipher is a encryption/decryption module.

Functions:
    xorcipher.create(decrypt, data, [key])
        Arguments:
            decrypt
                -set to false to encrypt data, true to decrypt data.
            data
                -the data to be encrypted/decrypted.
            key
                -The key to decrypt the data. (only required if decrypting)
        Return value:
            Formats:
                table [cipherobj]
            Description:
                1 - table [cipherobj]
                    -table containing the nessesary data and an iterator

    cipherobj.iterate(self, [num])
        Arguments:
            num
                -set to the number of chars to be encrypted/decrypted this iteration
                -defults to 10 if not supplied
        Return value:
            Formats:
                bool, number
                bool, string, string
                bool, string
            Description:
                1 - bool 
                    -true if decryption is finished and results have been returned otherwise false.
                2 - string/number 
                    -If first value was false, then a number will be returned, this is the percent completed.
                    -If the first value was true, this will be a string containing the encrypted/unencrypted data depending on the mode
                3 - string
                    -The key to decrypt the data if it was encrypting

Objects:
    cipherobj:
        key - the key to decrypt the data
        data - the decrypted data
        ciphertext - the encrypted data
        pos - the position in the data
        datalen - the length of the data
        iterate - the iterator function
